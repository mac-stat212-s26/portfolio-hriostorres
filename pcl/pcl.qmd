We pretend the Earth is an ellipsoid, but there is a lot of disagreement when plotting the world map. The U.S. has a metric system surprisingly!

  
**Ellipsoid:** shape of the earth 

**Datum:** where the ellipsoid goes

**Projection:** how to flatten 2D or 3D

**CRS** = Datum + Ellipsoid


> Why do we use many different local CRSs rather than just one CRS for the whole earth?

  - Accuracy and Precision. The ellipsoid model doesn't fit perfectly, so we adjust the model and datum for each small region.

> Why do we care about Coordinate Reference System?

  - Different datasets may use different CRSs. If these CRSs are not accounted for, the spatial points/regions will not align correctly on a map.

  - Different CRSs may use different units (e.g., meters, feet). Consistency in units is essential for accurate distance and area calculations.

  - Joining datasets from multiple sources requires a common CRS.
  
  
## Structure Data. Types: Revisited

  - list: most common one. Could be name and unnamed when referring to the elements in this list.
    - vector: name and unammed
    - dataframe:named list. All the columns have a name.
      - tibble: a special type of data frame
      - sf: it has a geometry column.
      
## Visualizing Spatial Data

1. Get the spatial data, usually by obtaining a shapefile and read using sf::st_read or "USAboundaries"
2. Joint other data. **Important:** Make sure both are in the same CRS, if not use *sf::st_crs* & *sf::st_transform.*
3. Plot sf::geom_sf
