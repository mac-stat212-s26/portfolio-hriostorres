    "text": "Conclusions\nTo understand how capital stock varies by legal nature among micro-enterprises, I first examined both mean and median capital stock values. Comparing these two measures helps assess the influence of remaining outliers and skewness in the data.\nFig. 1 reveals the differences in how capital stock is distributed across legal forms for both micro- and small enterprises in Brazil. Even after restricting the study to firms with less than 1 million BRL in capital, given the amount of outliers, the spread and tendency of capital stock vary a lot by legal nature. Note that this study assumes that both micro- and small-enterprises reports their capital stock consciously.\nFor micro-enterprises, most legal forms are located at low levels of declared capital. But there some enterprises that contradicts this. For example, Limited Liability Business Companies (LLCs) and Individual Limited Liability Companies display wider spreads and more outliers, suggesting that these structures are associated with firms that declare more capital even within the smallest size category. This would be an interesting study to pursue further with more time.\nAmong small enterprises, these differences become more obvious. Legal forms such as LLCs and Simple Limited Partnerships have higher medians and greater variability, while simpler structures remain concentrated at lower capital levels. This pattern indicates that whenever enterprises grow, the choice of legal nature becomes more strongly associated with how much capital they report.\nOne challenge I had during this project was dealing with outliers. I decided to limit the study to those firms with less than 1 million BRL in capital, but I do recognize this is not the best way to go about it. Future studies should look at it from a proportion perspectives comparing to their median value in each legal category. Another possibility could be using a logarithmic transformation to emphasize proportional differences rather than absolute values on the capital stock variable.\nOverall, our last visualization shows that legal nature is not just a formal label but carries information about the financial structure and scale of Brazilian enterprises. Even within the micro- and small-enterprise categories, organizational form is closely related to how much capital a firm declares.",

    "text": "Conclusions\nIn this TT challenge, I found out two things:\n\nSaturday dominates medal events.\nSport-specific distribution patterns are evident.\n\nThe heatmap shows that Freestyle Skiing has the highest concentration of medal events. From prior knowledge, there was significant attention and anticipation surrounding the competition between the U.S. and Japan in this discipline. Ultimately, the Japanese team won the gold medal, while the U.S. team earned silver.\n\nIt’s worth noting that some sports have not yet occurred, which directly affects our interpretation of the plot.\n\nDespite this, we can observe interesting temporal patterns and strategic insights from the 2026 Winter Olympics schedule:\n\nFriday serves as a “pre-weekend peak” with high medal event concentration, particularly in Freestyle Skiing, creating momentum leading into the weekend\nThursday represents a mid-week surge, possibly timed to maintain audience engagement between the weekend peaks\nSunday maintains strong medal activity, ensuring the week ends on a high note before the Monday reset\n\nOverall, the 2026 Winter Olympics schedule demonstrates careful planning: Saturday serves as the apex for medal events, while the distribution across disciplines highlights sports prominence, with Freestyle Skiing and Speed Skating leading the way. At the same time, the temporal patterns balance weekend viewership peaks with consistent daily engagement across the Games.",
