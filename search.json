    "text": "Conclusions\nTo understand how capital stock varies by legal nature among micro-enterprises, I first examined both mean and median capital stock values. Comparing these two measures helps assess the influence of remaining outliers and skewness in the data.\nFig. 1 reveals the differences in how capital stock is distributed across legal forms for both micro- and small enterprises in Brazil. Even after restricting the study to firms with less than 1 million BRL in capital, given the amount of outliers, the spread and tendency of capital stock vary a lot by legal nature. Note that this study assumes that both micro- and small-enterprises reports their capital stock consciously.\nFor micro-enterprises, most legal forms are located at low levels of declared capital. But there some enterprises that contradicts this. For example, Limited Liability Business Companies (LLCs) and Individual Limited Liability Companies display wider spreads and more outliers, suggesting that these structures are associated with firms that declare more capital even within the smallest size category. This would be an interesting study to pursue further with more time.\nAmong small enterprises, these differences become more obvious. Legal forms such as LLCs and Simple Limited Partnerships have higher medians and greater variability, while simpler structures remain concentrated at lower capital levels. This pattern indicates that whenever enterprises grow, the choice of legal nature becomes more strongly associated with how much capital they report.\nOne challenge I had during this project was dealing with outliers. I decided to limit the study to those firms with less than 1 million BRL in capital, but I do recognize this is not the best way to go about it. Future studies should look at it from a proportion perspectives comparing to their median value in each legal category. Another possibility could be using a logarithmic transformation to emphasize proportional differences rather than absolute values on the capital stock variable.\nOverall, our last visualization shows that legal nature is not just a formal label but carries information about the financial structure and scale of Brazilian enterprises. Even within the micro- and small-enterprise categories, organizational form is closely related to how much capital a firm declares.",

Ultimately, the Japanese team won the gold medal, while the U.S. team earned silver.\n\nIt’s worth noting that some sports have not yet occurred, which directly affects our interpretation of the plot.\n\nDespite this, we can observe interesting temporal patterns and strategic insights from the 2026 Winter Olympics schedule:\n\nFriday serves as a “pre-weekend peak” with high medal event concentration, particularly in Freestyle Skiing, creating momentum leading into the weekend\nThursday represents a mid-week surge, possibly timed to maintain audience engagement between the weekend peaks\nSunday maintains strong medal activity, ensuring the week ends on a high note before the Monday reset\n\nOverall, the 2026 Winter Olympics schedule demonstrates careful planning: Saturday serves as the apex for medal events, while the distribution across disciplines highlights sports prominence, with Freestyle Skiing and Speed Skating leading the way. At the same time, the temporal patterns balance weekend viewership peaks with consistent daily engagement across the Games.",

Similarly, the total agricultural production in New Zealand dropped prior to the 2000 and early 2000’s. This can either be explain by macro-economic shocks or missingness of data. Life stock and land area decreased its importance is terms of production value which is surprising!",

    "text": "Exercise 2\nNavigate the Geoms section of the ggplot2 reference page to find a geom that corresponds to the visual elements in the temperature plot. Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotedata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs. Your plot should look like the one below. The hex code of the used light tan color is #ECEBE3.\n\n\nSFO Weather Records in 2011\n\n\nCodeweather |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=dateInYear)) +\n  geom_linerange( data = weather,\n    aes(ymax = RecordHigh, ymin = RecordLow ),\n    color = \"#ECEBE3\",\n    size = 2) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipKeyboard Shortcuts\n\n\n\nAs you work on this plot, try to use some new keyboard shortcuts. Focus on the following:\n\nInsert code chunk: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows). Option+Command+I (Mac).\nRun current code chunk: Ctrl+Shift+Enter (Windows). Command+Shift+Return (Mac).\nRun current line/currently selected lines: Ctrl+Enter (Windows). Command+Return (Mac).",

Using the class() function we can check the class (type) of object that we just read in.

What is the difference between the _d(), _c(), and _b() variants of this function?\nAdding Elevation Raster Data\nWhere are large cities located? Is there some relationship to local geography/terrain?\n\nTo investigate these questions, we can obtain elevation data to include on the map using the elevatr package. We encounter two new functions here—we can look up their documentation to make sense of the code by entering the following in the Console:\n\n\n?elevatr::get_elev_raster\n?terra::as.data.frame\n\n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties, z = 5, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nBuild on our existing map by adding a raster layer for elevation as the background.\n\nLook up the documentation for geom_raster() to plot the elevation data from elev_df. This will be the first layer of the plot.\nLook at the documentation for scale_fill_gradient() to add the following elevation color scale: \"darkgreen\" represents the lowest elevations, and \"white\" represents the highest elevations.\nAdd in the layers from the map above to show the largest cities and the county outlines. To remove a background color, use fill = NA.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y,fill = elevation)) +\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = 'darkgreen', high = 'white') +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n   \n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # move legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom in to Twin Cities and Add Water\n\nThe bulk of the interesting information in this map is in the Twin Cities area. Let’s zoom in to this area.\n\n\nWe can use the st_bbox() function to get the bounding box for a spatial object—we do this after filtering to the 7 counties in the Twin Cities.\nWe then use st_crop() to trim a spatial object to a given bounding box.\n\n\nCodenames(mn_counties)\n\n [1] \"statefp\"           \"countyfp\"          \"countyns\"         \n [4] \"geoidfq\"           \"geoid\"             \"name\"             \n [7] \"namelsad\"          \"stusps\"            \"namelsad\"         \n[10] \"lsad\"              \"aland\"             \"awater\"           \n[13] \"state_abbr\"        \"jurisdiction_type\" \"geometry\"         \n\nCode# Let's rename the second one\nnames(mn_counties)[9] &lt;- \"namelsad2\"\n\n\nseven_countyarea &lt;- mn_counties |&gt;\n    filter(name %in% c(\"Anoka\", \"Hennepin\", \"Ramsey\", \"Dakota\", \"Carver\", \"Washington\", \"Scott\")) |&gt; \n    st_bbox()\n\nseven_countyarea\n\n     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax \n 419967.1 4924212.8  521254.8 5029157.4 \n\nCodecounty_crop &lt;- mn_counties %&gt;% st_crop(seven_countyarea) %&gt;% st_cast('MULTIPOLYGON')\n\nelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(county_crop, z = 9, clip = 'bbox')\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nIn the plot below, we add a layer for water information and a coord_sf() layer to restrict the x and y-axis limits to the Twin Cities bounding box. (Without this layer, the map would zoom back out to show all counties and bodies of water).\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode    # remove legend\n\n\nLet’s add to the above code chunk to save the map above to an image file called tc_map_zoom.png in the figures folder. The code example below shows a general template for saving a plot to file. Choose a reasonable width and height. (There are also jpeg() and pdf() functions for writing images.)\n\nCodepng(\"../figures/tc_map_zoom.png\", width = 1040, height = 1040, units = \"px\")\n# Code for creating plot\ndev.off()",

The types that are relevant to data science are:\n\n\nlogical (also known as boolean)\nnumbers\n\ninteger\n\nnumeric floating point (also known as double)\n\n\n\ncharacter string\n\nDate and date-time (saved as POSIXct)\nfactor\n\nFunction documentation will refer to vectors frequently.\nSee examples below:\n\n\nggplot2::scale_x_continuous()\n\n\nbreaks: A numeric vector of positions\n\nlabels: A character vector giving labels (must be same length as breaks)\n\n\n\nshiny::sliderInput()\n\n\nvalue: The initial value of the slider […] A length one vector will create a regular slider; a length two vector will create a double-ended range slider.\n\n\n\nWhen you need a vector, you can create one manually using\n\n\nc(): the combine function\n\nOr you can create one based on available data using\n\n\ndataset |&gt; mutate(newvar = variable &gt; 5) |&gt; pull(newvar): taking one column out of a dataset\n\ndataset |&gt; pull(variable) |&gt; unique(): taking one column out of a dataset and finding unique values\n\n\nCodec(\"Fair\", \"Good\", \"Very Good\", \"Premium\", \"Ideal\")\n\n[1] \"Fair\"      \"Good\"      \"Very Good\" \"Premium\"   \"Ideal\"    \n\nCodediamonds |&gt; pull(cut) |&gt; unique()\n\n[1] Ideal     Premium   Good      Very Good Fair     \nLevels: Fair &lt; Good &lt; Very Good &lt; Premium &lt; Ideal",

    "text": "Logicals\nNotes\nWhat does a logical vector look like?\n\nCodex &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA)\nx\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE    NA\n\nCodeclass(x)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nYou will often create logical vectors with comparison operators: &gt;, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=.\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 9, 12)\nx &lt; 2\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\nCodex &lt;= 2\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\nCodex &gt; 9\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nCodex &gt;= 9\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\nCodex == 12\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nCodex != 12\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nWhen you want to check for set containment, the %in% operator is the correct way to do this (as opposed to ==).\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 9, 4)\nx == c(1, 2, 4)\n\nWarning in x == c(1, 2, 4): longer object length is not a multiple of shorter\nobject length\n\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\nCodex %in% c(1, 2, 4)\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nThe Warning: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length is a manifestation of vector recycling.\nIn R, if two vectors are being combined or compared, the shorter one will be repeated to match the length of the longer one–even if longer object length isn’t a multiple of the shorter object length. We can see the exact recycling that happens below:\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 9, 4)\nx == c(1, 2, 4)\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\nCodex == c(1, 2, 4, 1) # This line demonstrates the recycling that happens on the previous line\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nLogical vectors can also be created with functions. is.na() is one useful example:\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 4, 9, NA)\nx == NA\n\n[1] NA NA NA NA\n\nCodeis.na(x)\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nWe can negate a logical object with !. We can combine logical objects with & (and) and | (or).\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 4, 9)\nx &gt; 1 & x &lt; 5\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\nCode!(x &gt; 1 & x &lt; 5)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nCodex &lt; 2 | x &gt; 8\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nWe can summarize logical vectors with:\n\n\nany(): Are ANY of the values TRUE?\n\nall(): Are ALL of the values TRUE?\n\nsum(): How many of the values are TRUE?\n\nmean(): What fraction of the values are TRUE?\n\n\nCodex &lt;- c(1, 2, 4, 9)\nany(x == 1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nCodeall(x &lt; 10)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nCodesum(x == 1)\n\n[1] 1\n\nCodemean(x == 1)\n\n[1] 0.25\n\n\nif_else() and case_when() are functions that allow you to return values depending on the value of a logical vector. You’ll explore the documentation for these in the following exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: ifelse() (from base R) and if_else() (from tidyverse) are different functions. We prefer if_else() for many reasons (examples below).\n\nNoisy to make sure you catch issues/bugs\nCan explicitly handle missing values\nKeeps dates as dates\n\n\nExamples\n\nCodex &lt;- c(-1, -2, 4, 9, NA)\n\nifelse(x &gt; 0, 'positive', 'negative')\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"negative\" \"positive\" \"positive\" NA        \n\nCodeif_else(x &gt; 0, 'positive', 'negative')\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"negative\" \"positive\" \"positive\" NA        \n\nCodeifelse(x &gt; 0, 1, 'negative') # Bad: doesn't complain with combo of data types\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"negative\" \"1\"        \"1\"        NA        \n\nCodeif_else(x &gt; 0, 1, 'negative') # Good:noisy to make sure you catch issues\n\nError in `if_else()`:\n! Can't combine `true` &lt;double&gt; and `false` &lt;character&gt;.\n\nCodeif_else(x &gt; 0, 'positive', 'negative', missing = 'missing') # Good: can explicitly handle NA\n\n[1] \"negative\" \"negative\" \"positive\" \"positive\" \"missing\" \n\nCodefun_dates &lt;- mdy('1-1-2025') + 0:365\nifelse(fun_dates &lt; today(), fun_dates + years(), fun_dates) # Bad: converts dates to integers\n\n

    "section": "Factors",
    "text": "Factors\nNotes\nCreating factors\nIn R, factors are made up of two components: the actual values of the data and the possible levels within the factor. Creating a factor requires supplying both pieces of information.\n\nCodemonths &lt;- c(\"Mar\", \"Dec\", \"Jan\",  \"Apr\", \"Jul\")\n\n\nHowever, if we were to sort this vector, R would sort this vector alphabetically.\n\nCode# alphabetical sort\nsort(months)\n\n[1] \"Apr\" \"Dec\" \"Jan\" \"Jul\" \"Mar\"\n\n\nWe can fix this sorting by creating a factor version of months. The levels argument is a character vector that specifies the unique values that the factor can take. The order of the values in levels defines the sorting of the factor.\n\nCodemonths_fct &lt;- factor(months, levels = month.abb) # month.abb is a built-in variable\nmonths_fct\n\n[1] Mar Dec Jan Apr Jul\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nCodesort(months_fct)\n\n[1] Jan Mar Apr Jul Dec\nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\nWhat if we try to create a factor with values that aren’t in the levels? (e.g., a typo in a month name)\n\nCodemonths2 &lt;- c(\"Jna\", \"Mar\")\nfactor(months2, levels = month.abb)\n\n[1] &lt;NA&gt; Mar \nLevels: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\nBecause the NA is introduced silently (without any error or warnings), this can be dangerous. It might be better to use the fct() function in the forcats package instead:\n\nCodefct(months2, levels = month.abb)\n\nError in `fct()`:\n!

Note that in all regex’s below the ?, +, * applies to the b only (not the a).\n\nCodestr_view(c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\"), \"ab?\")\nstr_view(c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\"), \"ab+\")\nstr_view(c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\"), \"ab*\")\n\n\n\nWe can match any of a set of characters with [] (called a character class), e.g., [abcd] matches “a”, “b”, “c”, or “d”.\n\nWe can invert the match by starting with ^: [^abcd] matches anything except “a”, “b”, “c”, or “d”.\n\n\n\n\nCode# Match words that have vowel-x-vowel\nstr_view(words, \"[aeiou]x[aeiou]\")\n\n[284] │ &lt;exa&gt;ct\n[285] │ &lt;exa&gt;mple\n[288] │ &lt;exe&gt;rcise\n[289] │ &lt;exi&gt;st\n\nCode# Match words that have not_vowel-y-not_vowel\nstr_view(words, \"[^aeiou]y[^aeiou]\")\n\n[836] │ &lt;sys&gt;tem\n[901] │ &lt;typ&gt;e\n\n\nExercise Using the words data, find words that have two vowels in a row followed by an “m”.\n\nCode# Your code\n\n\n\nThe alternation operator | can be read just like the logical operator | (“OR”) to pick between one or more alternative patterns. e.g., apple|banana searches for “apple” or “banana”.\n\n\nCodestr_view(fruit, \"apple|melon|nut\")\n\n [1] │ &lt;apple&gt;\n[13] │ canary &lt;melon&gt;\n[20] │ coco&lt;nut&gt;\n[52] │ &lt;nut&gt;\n[62] │ pine&lt;apple&gt;\n[72] │ rock &lt;melon&gt;\n[80] │ water&lt;melon&gt;\n\n\nExercise: Using the fruit data, find fruits that have a repeated vowel (“aa”, “ee”, “ii”, “oo”, or “uu”.)\n\nCode# Your code\n\n\n\nThe ^ operator indicates the beginning of a string, and the $ operator indicates the end of a string. e.g., ^a matches strings that start with “a”, and a$ matches words that end with “a”.\nParentheses group together parts of a regular expression that should be taken as a bundle. (Much like parentheses in arithmetic statements.)\n\ne.g., ab+ is a little confusing. Does it match “ab” one or more times? Or does it match “a” first, then just “b” one or more times? (The latter, as we saw in an earlier example.) We can be very explicit and use a(b)+.\n\n\n\nExercise: Using the words data, find (1) words that start with “y” and (2) words that don’t start with “y”.\n\nCode# Your code",

Missing values for this could indicate that the respondent uses a non-binary designation. Instead of dropping these cases, treating the missing data as its own category (“Does not wish to answer”) would be more appropriate.\nPros: Maintains sample size, may help us if data is “missing not at random”\nCons: Not directly applicable to continuous outcomes (could include interactions with a categorical version in models to account for it)\n\n\n\nImpute (or fill in values for) the missing data using imputation algorithms.\n\nImputation algorithms can be as simple as replacing missing values with the mean of the non-missing values (very simplistic).\nRegression imputation algorithms use models to predict missing values as a function of other variables in the data.\nPros: Maintains sample size, multiple regression imputation minimizes bias if “missing at random”\nCons: Computationally intensive\n\n\n\n\nDeciding between these options and proceeding with choosing finer details within an option requires an understanding of the mechanism by which data become missing.",

    "text": "Missing Data Mechanisms\nThe reasons for which a variable might have missing data are divided into 3 mechanisms: MCAR, MAR, and MNAR.\nWithin a dataset, multiple mechanisms may be present–we need to consider the missingness mechanism for each variable individually.\n\n\n\nMissing completely at random (MCAR):\n\nThe probability of missing data for a variable is the same for all cases. Implies that causes of the missing data are unrelated to the data. (https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-MCAR.html)\nExamples:\n\nMeasurement device that runs out of batteries causes the remainder of observations for the day to be missing.\nData entry software requires a particular field to be typo-free, and missing values are introduced when there are typos.\n\n\nImplications for downstream work:\n\nIf a variable has MCAR missingness, a complete case analysis will be unbiased (still valid).\nHowever, with a lot of missing observations, a complete case analysis will suffer from loss of statistical power (ability to detect a real difference), and imputation will be useful to retain the original sample size.\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing at random (MAR):\n\nThe probability of missing data is related to observed variables but unrelated to unobserved information.\nExamples:\n\nBlood pressure measurements tend to be missing in patients in worse health. (Those in worse health are more likely to miss clinic visits.) Better and worse health can be measured by a variety of indicators in their health record.\nIn a survey, older people are more likely to report their income than younger people. Missingness is related to the observed age variable, but not to unobserved information.\n\n\nImplications for downstream work:\n\nTry to use imputation methods that predict the value of the missing variables from other observed variables. Assessing whether this can be done accurately takes some exploration–we’ll explore this shortly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing not at random (MNAR):\n\nThe probability of missing data is related to unobserved variables (and probably observed variables too).\nExamples:\n\nBlood pressure measurements are more likely to be missing for those with the highest blood pressure. This is MNAR rather than MAR because the missing data on blood pressure is related to the unobserved values themselves.\nHigh-income individuals may be less likely to report their income.\n\n\nImplications for downstream work:\n\nIdeally, we would learn more about the causes for the missingness. This could allow us to use more informed imputation models.\n\nExample: Biological measurements that tend to be missing because of concentrations that are too low (a phenomenon known as left-censoring). Imputation methods specifically suited to left-censoring are useful here.\n\n\nWe can use imputation methods with different assumptions about the missing data and try out a variety of assumptions. This lets us see how sensitive the results are under various scenarios.\n\nExample: If higher incomes are more likely to be missing, we can make different assumptions about what “high” could be to fill in the missing values and see how our results change under these different assumptions.",

This means that:\n\nStandard errors are lower than they should be.\nConfidence intervals won’t contain the true parameter value the “advertised” percentage of times\n\ne.g., 95% confidence intervals will not contain the truth in 95% of samples–the coverage probability will be less than 95%\n\n\n\n\n\nIn multiple imputation, multiple imputed datasets are generated with different values for the filled-in data.\n\nSubsequent models are fit on each of these datasets, and both estimates and uncertainty measures are pooled across all of these fits.\nMultiple imputation more accurately estimates uncertainty measures.",

    "text": "Approaches to Missing data\nThere are 3 main ways of proceeding:\n\nDrop the cases with missing data from the analysis\nFor some variables, a missing value might be meaningful itself in a category.\n\nExample: The survey question “What is your gender?” might only provide two responses: “male” and “female”. Missing values could indicate that the respondent uses a non-binary designation. Thus, instead of dropping these cases, treating the missing data as its own category (“Other”) could be more appropriate.\n\nImpute (fill in) the missing data using imputation algorithms. Imputation algorithms can be as simple as replacing missing values with the mean of the non-missing values. More sophisticated imputation algorithms use models to predict missing values as a function of other variables in the data.\n\nConfused on which to use? That’s fair and for that we have to understand the mechanism by which data become missing.",

    "section": "Missing Data Mechanisms",
    "text": "Missing Data Mechanisms\nThis is a big topic, so let’s start slowly:\n\nMissing Completely At Random (MCAR): This is when the probability of missing data for a variable is the same for all cases. Implies that causes of the missing data are unrelated to the data. Examples:\n\nYou collect data and the librarian says that 5% of the times they forget to register a book loan, and this is random.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nIf MCAR, then complete case analysis will be unbiased.\nWith a lot of missing observations, a complete case analysis will suffer from loss of statistical power, and imputation will be useful to retain the original sample size.\n\nMissing At Random (MAR): This is when the probability of missing data is related to observed variables but unrelated to unobserved information. Examples:\n\nIn a survey, older people are more likely to report their income than younger people. Missingness is related to the observed age variable, but not to unobserved information.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nUse imputation methods that predict the value of the missing variables from other observed variables and verify.\n\nMissing Not At Random (MNAR): The missingness of a value depends on a true value itself. Example:\n\nFollowing the income examples: High-income individuals may be less likely to report their income.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nLearn the reasons why, so we can use imputation models.\nWe can use imputation methods with different assumptions about the missing data and try out a variety of assumptions.\n\nExample: If higher incomes are more likely to be missing, we can make different assumptions about what “high” could be to fill in the missing values and see how our results change under these different assumptions.",

    "text": "Introduction\nHello, welcome to another blog. Today’s topic is Projection.\nAt the heart of every spatial visualization is a set of locations. One way to describe a location is in terms of coordinates and a coordinate reference system (CRS). There are three main components to a CRS: ellipsoid, datum, and a projection. I’ll be focusing here on the last one, projection, but before we start, here’s a reminder of what those terms mean: 1. The ellipsoid is part of a CRS is a mathematical model giving a smooth approximation to Earth’s shape. 2. The center of the ellipsoid is called a datum. 3. projection is how we transform the Earth 3D dimension into a 2D graph.",

    "section": "How to choose map projections?",
    "text": "How to choose map projections?\nThere’s a bunch of projections! For the more options refer to this cool pdf about map projections. Here are interesting ones:\nMercator Projection\nThe one on top is called the Mercator projection from the 1500’s! As you might be guessing, this is good for navigation as we have a standard north and south. The problem? It inflates some regions/areas, like the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLambert Azimuthal Equal-Area Projection\nThe second one was presented by Lambert in 1772 known as Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area Projection. It is most Suited for regions extending equally in all directions from center points, such as Asia and Pacific Ocean. The problem? While it correctly represents the territory of each country, it does a bad job with the angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoucaut Projection\nLastly, I pick a funny one called Foucaut Projection or Sinusoidal Equal Area. In this projection, distances are correct along all parallels and the central meridian(s). The problem? Shapes are increasingly distorted away from the central meridian(s) and near the poles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: I feel overwhelm, which one do I pick?\n\nThe answer will depend on your project, lol. But the main takeaway here is that you get to choose the projection you want to work with. The most used one, as stated above is the Mercator projection, but that does not mean you have to choose that one, right?\nI hope you have fun reading about projection.
